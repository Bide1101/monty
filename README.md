C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
This repository contains an implementation of stacks and queues in the C programming language. Stacks and queues are two fundamental data structures used in computer science to organize and manipulate data.

Stacks (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It means that the last element inserted into the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it as a stack of plates where you can only remove the topmost plate.


Queues (FIFO - First In, First Out)
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It means that the first element inserted into the queue is the first one to be removed. Think of it as a queue of people waiting in line where the first person to join is the first one to leave.
